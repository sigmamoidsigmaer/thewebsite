      You might be wondering...<br>
      Why has this retard not posted in such a long time?<br>
      The answer is: I quit HVH.<br>
      NOW you might ask WHY (you probably didn't).<br>
      I was making YouTube videos for fun, but it's just not fun anymore with all the oneways, cheat diff, and expensive ass fatality.<br>
      So I have decided to take a break or quit foreverâ€”haven't decided yet if I'm coming back.<br>
      EVERYONE GL. HF. in this shitty ass community.
